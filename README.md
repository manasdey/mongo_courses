=========== Mongodb developers course from (my lovely database from) 10gen ==============

Basically, I just put together the homework did and lessons I learned from one 
some of the creators of mongodb, an ** awesome and fast ** JSON based database.  

Note this course happened during a major AWS outage (almost unbelievable) and 
maybe the most catastrophic hurricane in the US, Sandy **October 29-October30** 
Even with some bumps, the couse is going great, content is amazing and dinamic is fun

More details here: https://education.10gen.com/courses/10gen/M101/2012_Fall/about

The content will increase in the next weeks, so wait before you fork this repo, since
the course is in progress during October 2012 and December 2012.

And if you are taking the couse, please don't look at the content (not cheap!)
or you will not learn as much as you want!

Thanks
