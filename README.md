=========== Mongodb developers course from (my lovely database from) 10gen ==============

Basically, I just put together the homework I did and lessons I learned on developer
mongodb training, an ** awesome and fast ** JSON based database.  

Note this course happened during a major AWS outage (almost unbelievable) and 
maybe the most catastrophic hurricane in the northeast of US, Sandy **October 29-October30** 
Even with some bumps, the couse is going great, content is amazing, dynamic and fun

More details here: https://education.10gen.com/courses/10gen/M101/2012_Fall/about

The content will increase in the next weeks, so wait before you fork this repo, since
the course is in progress during October 2012 and December 2012.

Btw if you are taking the couse, please don't look at the homeworks before you finish yours (no cheap!)
otherwise you will not learn as much as you want!

Thanks
